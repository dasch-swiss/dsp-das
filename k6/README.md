# DSP-DAS Performance Testing

This repository contains performance tests for the DSP-DAS project.
To run the tests, you need to install [k6](https://k6.io/).

Use brew to install it:

```sh
brew install k6
```

The test are based on the [k6 browser module](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6-browser/overview/) which brings browser automation and end-to-end web testing to k6 while supporting [core k6 features](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/http-requests/).

## Running the tests

You can run the tests using the following command:

```sh
k6 run tests/<test_script.js>
```

### Using `just`

We provide a `justfile` to make it easier to run the tests.

Listing all the available tests:

```sh
just list
```

You can run the tests _locally_ using the following command:

```sh
just run <test_name>
```

You can run the tests _in the [k6 cloud](https://k6.io/docs/cloud/)_ using the following command:

```sh
just run-cloud <test_name>
```

For running in the cloud you [need to login](https://k6.io/docs/cloud/creating-and-running-a-test/cloud-tests-from-the-cli/#run-test-on-the-cli).

## Developing the tests locally without k6 cloud

This setup contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that allows you to run the tests locally without having to install grafana. You can run the tests and export its metrics to the local grafana instance.

### Setting up the environment

Start Grafana with InfluxDB instances:

```sh
just grafana-up
```

#### Create a Dashboard for Browser Tests

This will open up the create dashboard page in the browser and copy the `grafana_dashboard.json` to your clipboard. On this page you have to "import a dashboard" and paste the json and save.

Stopping the grafana stack is done with:

```sh
just grafana-down
```

[IMPORTANT] The grafana setup is not persistent. If you stop the containers, the data will be lost and you will have to recreate the dashboard with the steps above.

#### Create a Dashboard for HTTP Tests

Grafana provides some [preconfigured dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/?search=k6), unfortunately they do not provide one for the browser metrics.
If you are using `k6`'s `http` for testing API you might want to import the [nr `2587` "k6 Load Testing Results"](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/2587-k6-load-testing-results/) dashboard.

### Visualizing the test results in Grafana

When running the tests you have to instruct k6 to export the metrics to the grafana instance. You can do this by setting the `K6_OUT` environment variable to the url of the influxdb instance.

We have a `just` command that sets this variable for you:

```sh
just run-grafana <test_name>
```
