// viewport, so the widths have to be devices here rather than anything set inside a story.
//
// Kept apart from pixeleye.config.ts so the main baseline is untouched: it runs against a
// Storybook built with only those stories (`npm run build-storybook:breakpoints`) and uploads
// to its own pixeleye project (PIXELEYE_BREAKPOINTS_TOKEN). Two builds for one commit in the
// same project would overwrite each other.
