/**
 * Pure reconstruction of the confirmed statement tree from decoded URL filter params. This is the
 * reconstruction used by the `searchState$` derivation. Given the URL's `FilterParam[]` and the
 * ontology's hydrated `Predicate[]`, it returns the `StatementElement[]` those params describe —
 * resolving each predicate by IRI and wiring parent/child links via `parentIndex`.
 *
 * `parentIndex` is a position in the *original* `filterParams` array (that is how the encoder assigns
 * it). Reconstruction therefore keeps a slot array aligned to those original indices — dropped entries
 * leave a `null` slot rather than shifting later ones — so a child's `parentIndex` still resolves to the
 * right parent even when an *earlier* entry was skipped (e.g. its predicate is not in the currently
 * hydrated ontology, common for shared/bookmarked URLs and ontology switches). Resolving into the
 * growing result array instead would misalign every index after the first drop, silently dropping or
 * reparenting subcriteria.
 *
 * Reconstruction rules:
 * - a `FilterParam` whose predicate IRI is not among `predicates` is skipped (its slot becomes `null`);
 * - a child whose `parentIndex` is out of range or points at a dropped (`null`) slot is skipped;
 * - a child inherits its parent's object node (when it is a `NodeValue`) as its subject node,
 *   and `parentStatementLevel + 1`.
