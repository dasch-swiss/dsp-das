# Data management

Once your [data model](https://docs.dasch.swiss/latest/DSP-APP/user-guide/project/#data-model) is ready, you're able to add data. The DSP-APP offers several possibilities to add data, whether you are starting from scratch or importing data from another program.

## Start from scratch

When a project starts from scratch, you will enter and generate new data directly in the DSP-APP itself. Generating new data can be done one by one with a form at the moment:

- Upload files, e.g., an audio file, photography, a video, or a document
- Augment the metadata

### Create new resource instances

You can create a new resource instance using the "create new resource" form:

![Create a new resource instance e.g. a new audio file](../../assets/images/create-new-res-btn.png)*There is a button to open the create new resource form in the main header.*

**Step1:** Select the project you want to work with (if you are part of several ones), select the ontology (if the project has several ones), and then select the resource class you want to create a new instance. Click on Next.

![Create a new resource instance e.g. a new audio file](../../assets/images/create-new-resource-form-step1.png)*Step 1: Create a new resource instance e.g. a new audio file.*

**Step2:** Fill in the form and upload the file if requested (depending on the type of resource). Please, note that the required fields are marked with an asterisk `*` after the property label. Click on `Save` to create the new resource instance. To go back to Step 1, click on `Back`. If you cannot click on `Save`, it means that a required field has not been filled in.

![Create a new resource instance e.g. a new audio file](../../assets/images/create-new-resource-form-step2.png)*Step2: Create a new resource instance e.g. a new audio file in MP3 format.*

N.B.: Please, note that the image, video, and audio files must be in one of the required file types supported by the database. The supported types are listed in the upload section of the form.
