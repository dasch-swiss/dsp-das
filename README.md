This app is a simple user interface for the Data and Service Center for the
Humanities DaSCH, which uses the Knora server application in the backend.

It's a system for annotation and linkage of sources in arts and humanities.

This project was generated with
[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.4.

Developed by the [DaSCH Team](https://dasch.swiss) in Basel.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app
will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can
also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the
`dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the
[Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Documentation / User guidelines

We built the user guidelines with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and published
them on Github: <https://dhlab-basel.github.io/Kuirl>.

The documentation is stored in folder `/docs`. To run it locally, you have to
switch to this folder with `cd docs` and start it with

```bash
jekyll serve
```

Point your web browser to <http://localhost:4000>

All documentation about the usage of Jekyll together with the Just-the-Docs theme
is described here: <https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/>
